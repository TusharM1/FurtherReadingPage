					<h2>Full Chess Set: A solid choice</h2>
					<p>
						Whether if you are an experienced chess player or just a beginner, every player needs a few
						things to get started: a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chessboard">board</a> to play on, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_set">game pieces</a> to put on the board, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_clock">clock</a> to keep
						time, and a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_chess#Score_sheet">score sheet</a> to write down your moves. In this chess set, you receive all of the
						things you need to play. The set comes in different colors and gives a choice of different
						scorebooks, but in this review, I will be reviewing it with the default score book. This set
						costs $90 dollars, which is a very reasonable price for what is included. Today, I will be
						reviewing this full chess set.
					</p>
					<p>
						Firstly, let’s talk about the board. This is a tournament size board with 2 ½ inch squares. This means you will be able to play on your board if you choose to play in a tournament, since boards and pieces are required to be larger than most common chess sets. The board is made of vinyl, so it is very durable and resistant to wear and tear. Many of the boards my local clubs chess sets are several years old and are still holding up quite well.
					</p>
					<p>
						Next, the pieces. These pieces are quite big with a 3 ¾ inch king. This is much larger than most common pieces, which makes for a much better playing experience when playing long games. In my personal experience, playing for long periods of time with larger pieces is much more pleasant, but of course, this is up to personal preference. The pieces are made of plastic, which feels to the hand better than rubber but not as nice as wood. These pieces are weighted so it is a nice middle ground between quality and price.
					</p>
					<p>
						The clock that comes with the set is a standard tournament clock. At any tournament you attend, a physical clock will be required. This is the most common clock used at tournaments so although it might be a bit difficult to configure it, there will usually be someone at the tournament hall willing to help you. If you plan to use this for personal use, I recommend just using a free app on your phone, since it is much easier to configure, and you likely already have a phone. Some people prefer a physical clock to use while playing to eliminate distractions or to free up their phone, it is ultimately personal preference.
					</p>
					<p>
						Another item included is the scorebook. You may not actually use this scorebook unless you are playing serious games and you would like to record them to review later. It’s not really essential but it is very useful when looking through old games to improve. This scorebook is a softcover and can only store 50 games. A scorebook that I bought when I went to my first tournament was a hardcover and had space for 100 games, which is much nicer.
					</p>
					<p>
						Lastly, the bag. Most chess bags come in two types: tournament bags and quivers. This bag is a
						tournament bag and it has a few advantages over quivers, namely that it has more space and
						compartments and is generally more durable in personal experience.

						Every component of this chess set is of good quality and will prepare you for your future in chess. I would rate it a solid 4/5 stars, given that it is a bit expensive because of the clock. The only thing I would change about this set is using a cheaper clock since most people don’t need this sophisticated of a clock, even with tournament play.

					<h2>USATE Chess Tournament: An event to remember</h2>
					<p>
						If you are looking for a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_tournament">chess tournament</a> to go to with some friends, <a href="https://njscf.org/usate/">USATE chess tournament</a> is a great choice. The tournament is a team tournament open to all people, and it is one of the largest on the east coast. The tournament is held every February in Parsippany NJ.  In this review, I will describe my experience of attending this tournament and what I liked and didn’t like about it.
					</p>
					<p>
						Chess has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/17/crosswords/chess/chess-is-booming.html">exploded in popularity recently</a> and many people are looking at in person tournaments to join. There are usually many different tournaments that one can join, but most of them are individual tournaments. There are also many online tournaments that you can join for free, but these tournaments don’t usually translate to any official rating increase. The in-person tournaments usually have an additional requirement of having a USCF membership as well, so please keep that in mind if you choose to attend one.
					</p>
					<p>
						The tournament hall was packed when I first attended. There must have been thousands of people there, parents and children, students and teachers. I have never seen this many people in my life coming together to play chess before, so this was certainly an eye-opening experience.
					</p>
					<p>
						One of the best aspects of the tournament is the people. You will meet many different people at this tournament, young and old, experienced and inexperienced. The variety of people you meet makes it much more friendly to beginners since there will be many people who are not that good but still love the game. Another good aspect of the tournament is the team building. Each team is 4 people, and you are competing as a team so you are trying to win in order for your team to get a good score. This is pretty different from most tournaments where you are competing by yourself.
					</p>
					<p>
						Sitting in the tournament hall with the board in front of you is a really unique experience. When the entire room of hundreds of people are playing, the room is nearly dead silent except for the occasional cough. With only the board and your opponent in front of you, it is a very nice getaway from the busy home or office life that many people have. Of course this is the case with almost all classical tournaments, but for some people, just having a place to escape to is a large reason why they enjoy playing in tournaments. Just a few rooms away from the playing hall is the skittles room, which is a room dedicated to playing recreational games when your game has finished, this is a place to socialize and meet other players, and I personally have met some very strong and talented players in this room.
					</p>
					<p>
						There are some aspects of the tournament that aren’t so great. The food selection at the venue where the tournament is being held is not great. The food is mostly unhealthy fast food and the selection is quite limited. It is also quite expensive and the restaurants around the hotel are much better in food and in pricing. Another aspect of the tournament that isn’t great is the price. It is $235 to enter in the tournament, which can be a quite expensive buy in for many people.
					</p>
					<p>
						Overall, if you are passionate about playing chess and you want to put your skills to the test, the USATE tournament is good option to look into.
