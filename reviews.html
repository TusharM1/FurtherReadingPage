					<h2>Full Chess Set: A solid choice</h2>
					<p>
						Whether if you are an experienced chess player or just a beginner, every player needs a few
						things to get started: a board to play on, game pieces to put on the board, a clock to keep
						time, and a scoresheet to write down your moves. In this chess set, you receive all of the
						things you need to play. The set comes in different colors and gives a choice of different
						scorebooks, but in this review, I will be reviewing it with the default score book. This set
						costs $90 dollars, which is a very reasonable price for what is included. Today, I will be
						reviewing this full chess set.
					</p>
					<br><br>
					<p>
						Firstly, let’s talk about the board. This is a tournament size board with 2 ½ inch squares. This
						means you will be able to play on your board if you choose to play in a tournament, since boards
						and pieces are required to be larger than most common chess sets. The board is made of vinyl, so
						it is very durable and resistant to wear and tear. Many of the boards my local clubs chess sets
						are several years old and are still holding up quite well.
					</p>
					<br><br>
					<p>
						Next, the pieces. These pieces are quite big with a 3 ¾ inch king. This is much larger than most
						common pieces, which makes for a much better playing experience when playing long games. In my
						personal experience, playing for long periods of time with larger pieces is much more pleasant,
						but of course, this is up to personal preference. The pieces are made of plastic, which feels to
						the hand better than rubber but not as nice as wood. These pieces are weighted so it is a nice
						middle ground between quality and price.
					</p>
					<br><br>
					<p>
						The clock that comes with the set is a standard tournament clock. At any tournament you attend,
						a physical clock will be required. This is the most common clock used at tournaments so although
						it might be a bit difficult to configure it, there will usually be someone at the tournament
						hall willing to help you. If you plan to use this for personal use, I recommend just using a
						free app on your phone, since it is much easier to configure, and you likely already have a
						phone. Some people prefer a physical clock to use while playing to eliminate distractions or to
						free up their phone, it is ultimately personal preference.
					</p>
					<br><br>
					<p>
						Another item included is the scorebook. You may not actually use this scorebook unless you are
						playing serious games and you would like to record them to review later. It’s not really
						essential but it is very useful when looking through old games to improve. This scorebook is a
						softcover and can only store 50 games. A scorebook that I bought when I went to my first
						tournament was a hardcover and had space for 100 games, which is much nicer.
					</p>
					<br><br>
					<p>
						Lastly, the bag. Most chess bags come in two types: tournament bags and quivers. This bag is a
						tournament bag and it has a few advantages over quivers, namely that it has more space and
						compartments and is generally more durable in personal experience.
					</p>
					<br><br>
					<p>
						Every component of this chess set is of good quality and will prepare you for your future in
						chess. I would rate it a solid 4/5 stars, given that it is a bit expensive because of the clock.
						The only thing I would change about this set is using a cheaper clock since most people don’t
						need this sophisticated of a clock, even with tournament play.

					<h2>USATE Chess Tournament: An event to remember</h2>
					<p>
						If you are looking for a chess tournament to go to with some friends, USATE chess tournament is
						a great choice. The tournament is a team tournament open to all people, and it is one of the
						largest on the east coast. The tournament is held every February in Parsippany NJ. In this
						review, I will describe my experience of attending this tournament and what I liked and didn’t
						like about it.
					</p>
					<br><br>
					<p>
						Chess has exploded in popularity recently and many people are looking at in person tournaments
						to join. There are usually many different tournaments that one can join, but most of them are
						individual tournaments.
					</p>
					<br><br>
					<p>
						The tournament hall was packed when I first attended. There must have been thousands of people
						there, parents and children, students and teachers. I have never seen this many people in my
						life coming together to play chess before, so this was certainly an eye-opening experience.
					</p>
					<br><br>
					<p>
						One of the best aspects of the tournament is the people. You will meet many different people at
						this tournament, young and old, experienced and inexperienced. The variety of people you meet
						makes it much more friendly to beginners since there will be many people who are not that good
						but still love the game. Another good aspect of the tournament is the team building. Each team
						is 4 people, and you are competing as a team so you are trying to win in order for your team to
						get a good score. This is pretty different from most tournaments where you are competing by
						yourself.
					</p>
					<br><br>
					<p>
						There are some aspects of the tournament that aren’t so great. The food selection at the venue
						where the tournament is being held is not great. The food is mostly unhealthy fast food and the
						selection is quite limited. It is also quite expensive and the restaurants around the hotel are
						much better in food and in pricing. Another aspect of the tournament that isn’t great is the
						price. It is $235 to enter in the tournament, which can be a quite expensive buy in for many
						people.
					</p>
					<br><br>
					<p>
						Overall, if you are passionate about playing chess and you want to put your skills to the test,
						the USATE tournament is good option to look into.
