					<h2>Minecraft: A game worth playing</h2>
					<br><br>
					Minecraft is one of the world’s most popular and well-known video games. Through its numerous
					updates over the years, the game has grown significantly in reach and in depth. Today, the game is
					more popular than ever, with millions of players around the world. But is it worth playing? In this
					review, I will be going over the different aspects of the game and giving my opinion on whether the
					game is worth the $27.
					<br><br>
					The game is an open world sandbox game where the player places and destroys blocks. There are two
					major game modes, survival and creative. In survival, the player explores and conquers the world,
					and must fight off monsters to reach the end of the game where they will kill a dragon. In creative,
					the player is able to build to their heart’s content. Bridges, houses, farms, contraptions, there
					are many different creations to be made. The world is procedurally generated, meaning that new
					biomes and generated structures are created as the player continues to explore. In this game, you
					can do almost anything.
					<br><br>
					The aspect of the game that I have had the most fun with is survival mode. I really love the
					challenge of having to create a house and look for food, and the I love the feeling of achievement
					when beating a difficult boss. The survival mode has seen significant changes over the years, with
					many new bosses and biomes to explore. This makes it always interesting to find the latest version
					and see what is in store. The community surrounding the game is also very welcoming and friendly,
					with many multiplayer servers to join if you are looking to make some friends.
					<br><br>
					The aspect of the game that is not so good is the graphics. With many games today, the graphics are
					a big selling point, taking advantage of the latest techniques to bring a very lifelike and
					realistic experience. This aspect of the game has not changed much since it was created, and many
					different modifications to the game have been made by the community to improve the way the game
					looks.
					<br><br>
					Overall, I think this game is very much worth a shot if you are looking for an easy game to get
					into.

					<h2>USATE Chess Tournament: An event to remember</h2>
					<br><br>
					If you are looking for a chess tournament to go to with some friends, USATE chess tournament is a
					great choice. The tournament is a team tournament open to all people, and it is one of the largest
					on the east coast. The tournament is held every February in Parsippany NJ. In this review, I will
					describe my experience of attending this tournament and what I liked and didn’t like about it.
					<br><br>
					Chess has exploded in popularity recently and many people are looking at in person tournaments to
					join. There are usually many different tournaments that one can join, but most of them are
					individual tournaments.
					<br><br>
					The tournament hall was packed when I first attended. There must have been thousands of people
					there, parents and children, students and teachers. I have never seen this many people in my life
					coming together to play chess before, so this was certainly an eye-opening experience.
					<br><br>
					One of the best aspects of the tournament is the people. You will meet many different people at this
					tournament, young and old, experienced and inexperienced. The variety of people you meet makes it
					much more friendly to beginners since there will be many people who are not that good but still love
					the game. Another good aspect of the tournament is the team building. Each team is 4 people, and you
					are competing as a team so you are trying to win in order for your team to get a good score. This is
					pretty different from most tournaments where you are competing by yourself.
					<br><br>
					There are some aspects of the tournament that aren’t so great. The food selection at the venue where
					the tournament is being held is not great. The food is mostly unhealthy fast food and the selection
					is quite limited. It is also quite expensive and the restaurants around the hotel are much better in
					food and in pricing. Another aspect of the tournament that isn’t great is the price. It is $235 to
					enter in the tournament, which can be a quite expensive buy in for many people.
					<br><br>
					Overall, if you are passionate about playing chess and you want to put your skills to the test, the
					USATE tournament is good option to look into.
